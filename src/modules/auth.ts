//its important that not just anyone be allowed to use our api. we need to be able to tell what user is making the request, so 
//we can scope their queries and writes to the user. We dont want one user having access to anothers data. To ensure this you have
//to protect your api. Using tokens such as a jwt is great for this. some other examples are api keys or usin session. 

//a jwt is a javascript object that using a secret can be converted to a random string, and given that same secret be converted back.
//the jwt is stored on the client that creates it and it is sent to the server with every request for auth purposes.

//on server side jwt's should be stored on an authorization header.
